Immutable-lodash is a utility belt for Immutable.JS

The API and examples are largely taken over
from John-David Dalton's original implementation, however I've taken care to only implement methods
missing from Immutable.JS. Most native array/object methods
such as `filter`, `map`, `find`, `join` already have great implementations within it.

Deep respect to John-David Dalton and Lee Byron for their impeccable work on lodash & immutable-js.


For the sake of brevity & legibility, the examples largely use `[]` to refer to `Lists`,
and `{}` to refer to `Maps`. Check the method parameter annotations in case of doubt!
